Okay, this is an excellent conceptual leap! The RFF paper itself (Figure 2d, Figure 6a "Pair Reasoning") hints at this iterative refinement. Moving from math problems (GSM8K) to general problem-solving (like system design or agentic decision-making) is a significant shift in complexity and the nature of "state" and "steps."

Let's call this new spec `GenerativeProblemSpec` or `SystemDesignSpec`.

**How it would differ from GSM8KSpec:**

1.  **Nature of the "Goal" (`derive_final_target`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** A single numeric variable (`final_answer`).
    *   **New Spec:** Not a variable, but a *description of a desired end-state*. For example, "A complete and feasible design for a microservices-based e-commerce backend," or "A robust plan to launch a new product." The symbolic target for the RFF controller might still be a placeholder like `"solution_complete"`, but the *meaning* of this target is tied to a qualitative description.

2.  **Workspace Content (`Workspace`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Primarily stores numeric variables and their string expressions.
    *   **New Spec:** Stores much richer, structured, and qualitative information.
        *   **System Design:** Components, their interfaces, data models, technology choices, rationales, identified risks, unresolved questions, constraints.
        *   **Agentic Decisions:** Sequences of actions, observed outcomes, belief states, goals/sub-goals, chosen strategies, evaluated options.
        *   The workspace would likely be a nested dictionary/list structure, not just flat key-value pairs. For example, `state['components']` could be a list of component description objects.

3.  **Parsing LLM Output (`parse_workspace_update`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Parses a simple JSON with `var`, `expr`, `value`.
    *   **New Spec:** Needs to parse more complex, possibly LLM-generated, structured output (e.g., JSON representing a design component, a decision rationale, or a proposed action). It might also need to interpret natural language updates if strict JSON isn't always produced. The LLM would be prompted to provide these structured updates.

4.  **Local Check (`check_local`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Checks if a numeric variable is present and valid.
    *   **New Spec:** This becomes much more nuanced and potentially LLM-driven itself.
        *   If `target_step` was "Define API for User Service," `check_local` might verify that the workspace now contains a new entry under `state['components']['user_service']['api_definition']` and that this definition isn't empty or trivial.
        *   It could involve heuristic checks (e.g., "Does the API definition include common CRUD endpoints if it's a data-centric service?").
        *   More advanced: It could even be a quick LLM call: "Does this proposed API definition for X seem plausible and internally consistent at a high level? (Yes/No/Partially + brief reason)".

5.  **Final Verification (`verify_final`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Compares a number to a gold standard.
    *   **New Spec:** This is the most significant change. There's rarely a single "gold answer" for a design or complex plan.
        *   Verification would likely be an LLM call: "Given the initial problem [problem_description] and the current proposed solution/plan [current_workspace_summary], does this solution appear complete, coherent, address all key requirements, and seem feasible? Identify any major gaps, inconsistencies, or unaddressed critical requirements."
        *   The `(is_correct, llm_answer_str, gold_answer_float)` tuple would change. `gold_answer_float` is irrelevant. `is_correct` would be True if the LLM (as verifier) deems the solution adequate. `llm_answer_str` would be the final proposed solution/plan.
        *   The `require_gold` parameter in `reason_from_future` becomes less about a numeric gold standard and more about whether this LLM-based final verification must pass.

6.  **Last Step Prompt (Backward Planning - G) (`prompt_last_step`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** "What variable do you need before `final_answer`?"
    *   **New Spec:** "Our ultimate goal is to [description_of_final_target]. The current state of our design/plan is [summary_of_workspace]. To make significant progress towards the final goal, what is the *single most important unresolved sub-problem, missing component definition, or critical decision* that we need to address *next*? This should be something whose resolution would unblock further progress or clarify a major aspect of the overall solution. Phrase this as a clear, actionable task or question. Avoid proposing something already well-defined in the current state."

7.  **Forward Step Prompt (R) (`prompt_forward_step`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** "Compute the value for variable `X`."
    *   **New Spec:** "The overall problem is [problem_description]. Our current design/plan state is [summary_of_workspace]. Your current task, derived from backward planning, is: [target_step_description (e.g., 'Define the database schema for the order_service')]. Propose a detailed solution/text/design for *this specific task*. Explain your reasoning and how it fits into the broader solution. Output your proposal in a structured format (e.g., JSON with fields like 'proposal_summary', 'details', 'rationale', 'potential_issues')."

8.  **Parsing Target Step (`parse_target_step`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Extracts a variable name.
    *   **New Spec:** Extracts the natural language description of the sub-problem/task identified by the G-prompt.

9.  **Alias Merging (`merge_aliases`):**
    *   **GSM8K:** Merges synonymous variable names.
    *   **New Spec:** This could be more complex. It might involve recognizing that "user authentication module" and "identity service" refer to the same conceptual component and consolidating their descriptions or linking them. This might also require LLM assistance.

**Logic Needed:**

*   **Qualitative Reasoning:** Ability to understand and generate descriptions, rationales, and arguments.
*   **Structured Knowledge Representation:** Managing complex, evolving data structures in the workspace.
*   **Decomposition:** Breaking down a large problem (e.g., "design an e-commerce site") into manageable sub-problems (e.g., "design user auth," "design product catalog API," "choose payment gateway"). This is what the G-prompt aims to elicit.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Implicitly, by checking if proposed solutions meet requirements.
*   **Trade-off Analysis (Implicit):** When making decisions, the LLM might internally weigh options, and the R-prompt could ask it to articulate these.
*   **Abstraction and Refinement:** Starting with high-level goals and progressively detailing components.
*   **Self-Correction/Critique:** The `verify_final` step is essentially a critique step. Local checks could also have a light critique aspect.

**Process and Flow:**

The RFF loop remains, but the *content* of G and R calls changes:

1.  **Initial Goal:** "Achieve a complete system design for X." (Symbolic target: `design_complete`)
2.  **Iteration 1 (G-Prompt):** "What's the first major component/decision needed for `design_complete` given an empty workspace?" -> LLM: "Define core services." (`target_step` = "Define core services")
3.  **Iteration 1 (R-Prompt):** "Define core services for X." -> LLM: Proposes `user_service`, `product_service`, `order_service` with brief descriptions (parsed into workspace).
4.  **Local Check:** Workspace now has entries for these services. Pass. (Assume `made_progress=True`).
5.  **Iteration 2 (G-Prompt):** "Goal: `design_complete`. Current state: basic core services defined. What's next most important unresolved task before `design_complete`?" -> LLM: "Specify API for `user_service`." (`target_step` = "Specify API for `user_service`")
6.  **Iteration 2 (R-Prompt):** "Specify API for `user_service`." -> LLM: Proposes API endpoints and data structures (parsed into workspace).
7.  ...and so on, iteratively detailing components, defining interfaces, making technology choices.
8.  **Final Check (`verify_final`):** After `max_iters` or if `design_complete` is directly attempted and "locally checked" (e.g., LLM claims it's done), a comprehensive LLM call reviews the entire workspace against the original problem.

        # For now, if the `target_step` (sub-task description) isn't the final goal,
        # we'll assume any structured update (e.g. new component/decision) means local check passed.
        # The real check is if `state[target_step]` exists if target_step was a variable.

**Explanation of how this `GenerativeProblemSpec` would work with RFF:**

1.  **Initialization:** You'd create `spec = GenerativeProblemSpec("Design a scalable social media platform for pet owners.")`.
2.  **RFF Loop Starts:**
    *   `goal = "overall_solution_achieved"`.
    *   **G-Prompt:** Asks what's the prerequisite for `overall_solution_achieved`. LLM might say: `"Define core features and user stories."` This becomes `target_step`.
    *   **R-Prompt:** Asks LLM to define core features. LLM outputs a JSON with `type: "component_list"`, `name: "core_features"`, `description: "[list of features]"` etc.
    *   `parse_workspace_update` adds this to `state['components']` or a dedicated `state['core_features']` list.
    *   `check_local` confirms that `state['core_features']` (or equivalent) now exists and is non-trivial.
    *   The loop continues. Next, G-Prompt might ask for prerequisites given core features are defined. LLM might say: `"Design database schema for user profiles."` R-Prompt addresses this.
3.  **Progression:** The workspace gradually fills with defined components, APIs, data models, technology decisions, rationales, etc. The `avoid` set in `prompt_last_step` helps prevent the LLM from repeatedly suggesting sub-tasks that didn't lead to progress or were poorly defined.
4.  **Termination:**
    *   After `max_iters`.
    *   If the G-prompt returns `overall_solution_achieved` as the `next_target_task_description`, meaning the LLM thinks it can now summarize the final solution. The R-prompt will then ask for this summary.
    *   `verify_final` is called. It uses another LLM call to assess the entire generated design in the workspace against the original problem. If the verifier LLM says it's adequate, the process might terminate successfully.

This new spec shifts RFF from solving problems with single, verifiable answers to guiding a generative process for complex, open-ended tasks where the "solution" is an elaborate artifact. The "local checks" are softer, and "final verification" is a qualitative assessment. The key is in the careful crafting of prompts for G and R steps to manage the state and guide the LLM's generative process effectively. The `require_gold=False` setting in `reason_from_future` would be typical here, as the final assessment is LLM-based.
