Remember we are using the new `google.genai` SDK for this project and **NOT** the old `google.generativeai` SDK which is deprecated. If needed, you can do a web search for the docs here: https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/index.html 

When running any of the code in this project, you will need to first activate the local Python environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`
