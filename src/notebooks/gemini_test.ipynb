      "### Random System Design Problem: **The \"CodeArena\" Automated Peer-Review & Grading Platform**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Problem Statement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Design a scalable, reliable, and secure online platform called \"CodeArena.\" Its primary purpose is to allow students to submit programming assignments, have them automatically graded, and also facilitate a **peer-review mechanism** where students review each other's code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Challenge:** The unique blend of automated grading, a robust and secure code execution environment, and a structured peer-review workflow with fairness mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Functional Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **User Management:**\n",
      "    *   Students can register, log in, and manage their profiles.\n",
      "    *   Instructors can register, log in, create courses, manage assignments, and view student progress/submissions.\n",
      "    *   Admins (optional, for system-level management).\n",
      "2.  **Course & Assignment Management:**\n",
      "    *   Instructors can create courses, add students to courses (or generate invite links).\n",
      "    *   Instructors can create assignments:\n",
      "        *   Define problem statements (markdown support).\n",
      "        *   Specify allowed programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).\n",
      "        *   Upload public test cases (visible to students).\n",
      "        *   Upload private/hidden test cases (for final grading).\n",
      "        *   Set submission deadlines, grading criteria, and peer-review windows.\n",
      "        *   Define peer-review rubric.\n",
      "3.  **Code Submission:**\n",
      "    *   Students can submit code files for a given assignment.\n",
      "    *   Support for multiple submissions; only the latest or best-scoring submission counts.\n",
      "    *   Real-time syntax highlighting in the submission editor.\n",
      "    *   Basic code linting/formatting (optional, but a nice-to-have).\n",
      "4.  **Automated Grading Engine:**\n",
      "    *   Execute submitted code against public and private test cases.\n",
      "    *   Run tests in a secure, isolated sandbox environment (prevent malicious code, infinite loops, resource hogging).\n",
      "    *   Capture `stdout`, `stderr`, and execution time/memory usage.\n",
      "    *   Provide immediate feedback to students on public test cases (pass/fail, output diff, runtime errors).\n",
      "    *   Final grading against private test cases upon deadline or instructor trigger.\n",
      "    *   Support for different test types (unit tests, performance tests).\n",
      "5.  **Peer Review System:**\n",
      "    *   After submission, students are assigned a set number of *anonymous* peer submissions to review (e.g., 3 submissions per student).\n",
      "    *   Students review code based on instructor-defined rubrics (e.g., code style, correctness, efficiency, comments).\n",
      "    *   Reviewers can add comments directly to lines of code.\n",
      "    *   Mechanism to flag inappropriate reviews or malicious code during review.\n",
      "    *   Students can see their own reviews (after the review period ends or final grades are released).\n",
      "    *   Instructors can monitor review progress and validity.\n",
      "    *   Fairness mechanism: Reviewers might be graded on the quality/consistency of their reviews.\n",
      "6.  **Results & Analytics:**\n",
      "    *   Students can view their scores, detailed test case results, and peer review feedback.\n",
      "    *   Instructors can view aggregated course statistics, individual student scores, submission history, and peer-review reports.\n",
      "    *   Export capabilities for grades and submission data.\n",
      "7.  **Notifications:**\n",
      "    *   Notify students about assignment deadlines, new assignments, grading completion, and peer-review assignments.\n",
      "    *   Notify instructors about new submissions, overdue reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Non-Functional Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Scalability:**\n",
      "    *   Support thousands of courses and hundreds of thousands of students.\n",
      "    *   Handle peak load during assignment deadlines (many concurrent submissions and grading requests).\n",
      "    *   Efficiently scale the automated grading infrastructure up and down.\n",
      "2.  **Reliability & Availability:**\n",
      "    *   High availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime). Submissions must not be lost.\n",
      "    *   Robust error handling for grading failures (e.g., re-queuing failed jobs).\n",
      "3.  **Performance:**\n",
      "    *   Low latency for code submission and feedback on public test cases (e.g., < 5 seconds for typical problems).\n",
      "    *   Peer review UI should be responsive.\n",
      "4.  **Security:**\n",
      "    *   **Critical:** Code execution sandboxing to prevent students from accessing underlying system resources, network, or other students' data.\n",
      "    *   Protect student and instructor data (PII, code solutions).\n",
      "    *   Secure authentication and authorization.\n",
      "    *   Prevent cheating (e.g., basic plagiarism detection for code, though this can be a stretch goal).\n",
      "5.  **Cost-Effectiveness:**\n",
      "    *   Optimize compute resources for grading (e.g., use spot instances, scale down idle resources).\n",
      "6.  **Maintainability & Extensibility:**\n",
      "    *   Easy to add new programming languages to the grading engine.\n",
      "    *   Easy to add new question types or peer-review criteria.\n",
      "7.  **Data Consistency:**\n",
      "    *   Ensure grades, submissions, and peer reviews are consistent across the system.\n",

      "**III. High-Level Architecture Considerations (What you'd discuss in an interview):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frontend:** Web application (React, Angular, Vue).\n",
      "*   **API Gateway:** For managing requests, authentication, rate limiting.\n",
      "*   **Core Services (Microservices approach likely):**\n",
      "    *   **User Service:** User profiles, authentication, authorization.\n",
      "    *   **Course/Assignment Service:** Manage course data, assignments, deadlines.\n",
      "    *   **Submission Service:** Store code submissions, manage submission state.\n",
      "    *   **Grading Orchestrator Service:** Coordinates grading jobs, puts them on a queue, collects results from workers.\n",
      "    *   **Grading Worker Pool:** A fleet of isolated, containerized environments (e.g., Docker containers running on Kubernetes) where actual code execution happens. Each worker picks a job from the queue.\n",
      "    *   **Peer Review Service:** Manages review assignments, rubric application, stores review data.\n",
      "    *   **Notification Service:** For emails, in-app notifications.\n",
      "    *   **Analytics Service:** Collects metrics, generates reports.\n",
      "*   **Databases:**\n",
      "    *   **Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL):** For structured data like user info, course details, assignment metadata, submission records, peer review assignments.\n",
      "    *   **Object Storage (S3/GCS):** For storing raw code submissions, test cases, potentially large grading logs.\n",
      "    *   **NoSQL DB (MongoDB/Cassandra):** Potentially for detailed test case results, intermediate grading outputs, or highly flexible review comments.\n",
      "*   **Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS):**\n",
      "    *   **Submission Queue:** Decouple submission from grading; handle bursts.\n",
      "    *   **Grading Result Queue:** Send results back to the orchestrator.\n",
      "    *   **Notification Queue:** For async notifications.\n",
      "*   **Caching (Redis/Memcached):**\n",
      "    *   Cache assignment details, popular course data, recent grading results for quick retrieval.\n",
      "*   **Security & Isolation:**\n",
      "    *   Docker containers or VMs for grading workers with strict resource limits and network isolation.\n",
      "    *   `seccomp`, `namespaces`, `cgroups` for Linux-based isolation.\n",
      "    *   Input sanitization, output filtering.\n",
